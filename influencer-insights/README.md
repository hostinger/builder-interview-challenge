# Influencer insights challenge

## Briefing

Marketing team found a website which contains a large list of Youtube channels – https://batgrowth.com/publishers/youtube. It seems this data would be beneficial for finding potential Youtube partners. Unfortunatelly, Batgrowth only allows filtering by country and that's not enough to derive useful insights. We need to build a better system.

## Quest 1 – Getting the data

How would you get the data from Batgrowth?

## Quest 2 – Additional data points

Batgrowth only provides channel IDs, names, total views and subscribers. We need more data. We should find

- Country
- Category(-ies)
- Keywords
- Any other useful properties

for each channel. How would you get them and store them?

## Quest 3 – Displaying the results

How would you present the results?
