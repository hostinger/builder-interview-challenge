# Pokedex challenge

Let's catch 'em all!

## Project setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start in development mode
npm start
```

## Briefing

Project is using Vue 2.

Feel free to use any additional libraries.

## Quest 1 - Fetch pokemon data

Here, take these Pokeballs – `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=10`. 10 Pokemon should be enough to get started on your adventure. First objective – get the data from this URL and `console.log` it.

## Quest 2 - List your pokemon

Now that you have pokemon data, you should make a list of their names and images.

There are no images in the response you got? Well, each pokemon object should have an url which will give you more data. Pokemon image is in `sprites.front_default`.

**The template/styles are already prepared in `<PokemonList>` component, just loop and connect the data.**

## Quest 3 - Choose your favorite pokemon

I know that you have a favorite pokemon. Your pokedex should have the ability to mark your favorite pokemon with a star. Star svg is commented out in `<PokemonList>`. Star should be filled when pokemon is favorited.

## Quest 4 - Show it to the world

Deploy this project. Optionally, set up SSL, CI/CD to show off your DevOps knowledge.
